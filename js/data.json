This is because we have realized that in the customer's eye most marketing is intrusive, while products are helpful. If we develop marketing in the same manner as products - i.e. in order to help people or solve a problem – customers are more likely to like the marketing and the brand.At Umwelt, we believe in full service with a digital core. We make digital solutions that help our customers set the digital agenda in their industry.
